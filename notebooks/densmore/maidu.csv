maidu001,Song of the Hesi Dance (a),1,,5,3,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of ceremonial dances,17,92,,92,1,2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|striking on a plank,,,,"This melody consists of a four-measure phrase, repeated 9 times with inter esting variations. A two-measure phrase occurs midway through the melody and at the close. The song has a compass of 5 tones and contains only the tones of the minor triad and fourth."
maidu002,Song of the Hesi Dance (b),2,,6,4,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of ceremonial dances,18,60,,60,1,3/4|2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|striking on a plank,,,,"An interesting dance rhythm occurs in this melody, the performance end ing on the fourth above the keynote. Several renditions of the repeated portion were recorded."
maidu003,Song of the Duck Dance (a),3,,16,8,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of ceremonial dances,18,88,,88,1,2/4|3/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"The longest tone in this song is the quarter note at the beginning of the repeated portion. This tone seems to steady the rhythm of the entire melody. Many short rests occur, and were given clearly. The song has a compass of 6 tones and is based on the fourth five-toned scale."
maidu004,Song of the Duck Dance (b),4,,15,8,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of ceremonial dances,19,72,,72,1,2/4|3/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,minor,"The rhythm of this melody is somewhat jerky, and the phrases are short. The tones are those of the minor triad and fourth and every phrase is descending in trend."
maidu005,Song of the Duck Dance (c),5,,7,3,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of ceremonial dances,19,60,,60,1,3/4,TRUE,,,voice,,"The first flowers are blooming, so we are glad.",minor,"In structure this melody resembles the first song of the Hesi (No. 1). A phrase containing two measures is repeated ten times, with slight variations. A one-measure phrase in a slightly different rhythm occurs midway the length of the melody. The rhythm and tones of the first measure are duplicated only in the third measure, while the rhythm and tones of the second measure recur several times in the melody. Like many songs of the Maidu, this melody has a compass of five tones and is based on the minor triad and fourth."
maidu006,Song of the Duck Dance (d),6,,8,4,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of ceremonial dances,20,60,,60,1,2/4,TRUE,,,voice,,"Lively, lively. We are lots of people.",major,"This melody resembles the preceding dance songs in its two-measure answering phrases, but differs in melodic structure. This melody is framed on two overlapping tetrachords (D-C-A and C-A-G), each phrase ending with an ascending fourth. The keynote is midway the compass of the melody. In the pre ceding songs the keynote is frequently the lowest tone occurring in the melody."
maidu007,Song of the Bear Dance (a),7,,18,10,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of ceremonial dances,21,80,,80,1,3/4|2/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,irregular,"This song has a marching rhythm and the phrases are short. The progressions suggest C sharp as the keynote, with a minor tonality. The third above C does not occur, but the sixth above C is a prominent tone and is a minor sixth above the keynote."
maidu008,Song of the Bear Dance (b),8,,17,9,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of ceremonial dances,21,88,,88,1,3/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"A swinging rhythm characterizes this song, which contains long phrases without a rest. An ascending fourth occurs frequently, and overlapping, descend ing tetrachords occur several times (C-B flat-G and B flat-G-F). The keynote is next to the highest tone, and the third occurs only as the initial unaccented tone. This song is an example of a melody with interval-formation."
maidu009,Song of the Bear Dance (c),9,,19,11,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of ceremonial dances,22,88,,88,1,2/4|3/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"This song opens with a lively rhythm, but the change of measure-length in the third measure introduces a heavier motion, characterized by a succession of eighth notes. The implied keynote is A flat, and the melody contains the tones of the fourth five-toned scale."
maidu010,Song of the Grasshopper Dance,10,,12,6,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of ceremonial dances,22,104,,104,1,2/4|3/4|3/8,TRUE,,,voice,,,minor,"The tonality of this melody is not clear, but it is transcribed as nearly as possible. The tone transcribed as C sharp was often sung above the indicated pitch, and the tone transcribed as E was not clear in its intonation; but both D sharp and A were given clearly. It is a peculiar melody with a graceful rhythm and many descending phrases. Two renditions were recorded and are alike in the essentials of rhythm and melody."
maidu011,The Dancers Approach the Lodge (a),11,,33,14,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,25,88,,88,1,3/4|2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,major,A peculiarity of this song is the prominence of the tone above the keynote which ends a majority of the phrases and is the final tone of the song. The only tones are those of the major triad and second. Several renditions were recorded and are identical.
maidu012,The Dancers Approach the Lodge (b),12,,21,9,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,26,60,,60,1,3/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,major,"The next song is different from the next preceding in melodic and rhythmic structure. It is based on the fourth five-toned scale and framed on two descending fourths which occur consecutively, about midway through the melody. The reversal of count divisions in succeeding phrases is interesting and shows a definite sense of rhythm. The swinging, swaying rhythm of the phrases beginning on C, with their descending trend, has been noted in several other Maidu dance songs."
maidu013,Social Dance Song (a),13,,32,19,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of social dances,26,88,,88,1,3/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,major,"In this song the keynote is in the middle of the compass and the tones are those of a major triad and second. Like the song next preceding, this is character ized by one-measure phrases, each followed by a short rest."
maidu014,Social Dance Song (b),14,,1,1,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,26,60,,60,1,2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,major,"The tempo of this song is slow, as in a majority of Maidu dance songs. The melody consists of only four phrases and was repeated many times. The tones are those of the fourth five-toned scale."
maidu015,Social Dance Song (c),15,,2,1,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of social dances,26,60,,60,1,2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,major,"The count-divisions in this melody are small and the range is low, as in many songs recorded by Indian women. The tones are those of the fourth five-toned scale, and attention is directed to the rhythm of the fourth measure from the close in which the final count reverses the divisions in the opening measure. Many renditions were recorded and are uniform in every respect."
maidu016,Social Dance Song (d),16,,13,7,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,27,56,,56,1,2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,irregular,"This melody is based on two intervals of a whole toneâ€” E-F sharp and B-C sharp. Two fourths, B-E and C sharp-F sharp, are also prominent in the melody. A pleasant swaying motion is given by the frequent ascent and descent of the phrases."
maidu017,Social Dance Song (e),17,,14,7,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of social dances,27,56,,56,1,2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,major,"The fourth five-toned scale forms the basis of this melody, which has a compass of seven tones. The keynote is next to the highest tone occurring in the song. The repeated portion was sung several times, the renditions being identical."
maidu018,Social Dance Song (f),18,,40,17,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,28,60,,60,1,2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,major,"Attention is directed to the break in the rhythm of this song, occurring in the fifth measure. A change of rhythm midway the length of an Indian song is noted frequently. The melody is based on the major triad with the keynote as the highest tone, which is a somewhat unusual placing of the melody."
maidu019,Social Dance Song (g),19,,46,19,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,28,56,56,56,1,2/4|3/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,minor,"The interval of a fourth constitutes the framework of this song, though it seldom occurs without a passing tone. Two renditions of the song were recorded, one with and one without the accompaniment of a clacker. The renditions were identical, except for the occasional substitution of E flat for G as the final tone in the fifth measure from the close. In both renditions the repeated portion was sung several times, and the second and third measures from the close were omitted in the ending of the performance. The clacker was synchronous with the voice in the measures having a predominance of sixteenth notes. In other measures it was less regular, though maintaining a general rhythm of sixteenth notes. (Compare No. 27.)"
maidu020,Social Dance Song (a),20,,51,30,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of social dances,28,60,,60,1,2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,major,"The phrasing of this melody is crisp and lively. The tones are those of the fourth five-toned scale, the phrases are chiefly descending, and the compass is an octave, which is larger than in a majority of Maidu songs."
maidu021,Toto Dance Song (a),21,,27,16,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of social dances,29,56,,56,1,3/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,minor,"A change of tempo and an elaborate rhythm characterize this song, which was repeated several times without change."
maidu022,Toto Dance Song (b),22,,28,17,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of social dances,29,60,,60,1,2/4|3/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,major,This melody progresses almost entirely by whole tones. It is based on the fourth five-toned scale and marked by descending slurred phrases.
maidu023,Circle Dance Song (a),23,,29,12,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,30,108,,108,1,2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,There is a cloud in the heavens.,minor,"With few exceptions the remaining Maidu songs are more rapid in tempo than those preceding. The tempo of this melody is a quarter note equivalent to 108, as measured by the metronome. The tones are those of the minor triad and fourth; the song has a compass of five tones and contains no change of measure-length."
maidu024,Circle Dance Song (b),24,,30,13,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,30,80,,80,1,2/4|3/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,Bring more wood.,minor,"This melody consists of five periods, generally containing two phrases of two measures each, which seem to answer each other. The song is based on the minor triad, with the fifth as the lowest tone."
maidu025,Closing Song of Circle Dance,25,,31,18,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs of social dances,31,92,,92,1,2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,All going around.,major,"Three renditions of this song were recorded without a pause. The rendi tions are alike except that the repetition of the first half occurs only in the first rendition. The melody contains only three tones, with whole tone intervals. The intonation was not accurate, as the Indian generally finds difficulty in maintaining the pitch-relation of a succession of small intervals."
maidu026,Dance Song from Grindstone Village (a),26,,10,6,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,31,60,,60,1,3/4|2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,major,"This melody progresses chiefly by whole-tone intervals, with the fourth as a prominent interval in the framework. It is characterized by a short note followed by a dotted note."
maidu027,Dance Song of Grindstone Village (b),27,,45,18,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,31,96,96,96,1,3/4|2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,minor,"In contrast to that next preceding, this melody is characterized by a dotted eighth followed by a sixteenth note. The principal tones are B, D, and E in the upper and lower octave. The song was recorded with the accompaniment of a clacker. Where audible, this was in strokes equivalent to a quarter note of the melody. (Compare No. 19.)"
maidu028,Song of a Jumping Dance,28,,37,15,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,32,96,,96,1,3/4|2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,"I jump down and dance, then I jump back up and dance.",minor,"The dance rhythm of this melody is simple and vigorous. The intervals are small and, as in similar instances, the intonation on these intervals was some what irregular. The last phrase of the song is repeated six times."
maidu029,Slide Dance Song,29,,47,20,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,33,60,,60,1,2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,"Dance, my sister-in-law",minor,"A rest occurs at the close of each measure in this melody. The tempo is slower than in a majority of the songs in the latter portion of this memoir, and the tones are those of the minor triad and fourth."
maidu030,Dream Dance Song,30,,9,5,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs of social dances,34,60,,60,1,2/4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,voice|clacker,,,major,"The framework of this melody consists of a major triad with a frequent descent to the minor third below the keynote. This series comprises a minor triad and minor seventh, and the tones, as in this instance, usually occur in descending order. It occurs in the second and third measures as the sequence B flat- G- E flat- C, and reappears throughout the melody. (Compare No. 46.)"
maidu031,Song of the Sand-Hill Cranes,31,,48,21,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs connected with gathering clover,35,152,,152,0.5,3/8,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"This song is connected with a story, and its structure offers a contrast to the ceremonial and social dance songs. This melody has a compass of an octave and moves freely between the highest and lowest tones of that compass. The count- divisions are small, and the song contains no change of measure lengths. The descending phrases may suggest the motion of the sand-hill cranes which are supposed to have given the song to the girls, while they were gathering clover."
maidu032,Song of the Two Boys Who Went for Clover,32,,35,22,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs connected with gathering clover,36,88,,88,1,2/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"Strong accents characterize this song, and we note that it concerns a difference of opinion between the boys and the girls. The melody contains only three tones, occurring in -varied order. The phrases contain two measures, each phrase followed by a rest. The singing could be continued indefinitely, with the phrases repeated in any desired order."
maidu033,"Come Home, Baby Is Crying",33,,20,12,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs connected with gathering acorns,38,63,,63,1,2/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,minor,"This is the only recorded Maidu song which is based on the second five- toned scale. It is minor in tonality and omits the second and sixth tones of the octave. The keynote is the highest note occurring in the song and is present in most of the measures. Short rests occur frequently. The entire form of the melody is in keeping with the words. It could be continued indefinitely, and only the first portion of the performance is presented. It was sung a semitone lower than the transcription."
maidu034,Bring a Blanket,34,,22,13,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs connected with gathering acorns,40,80,,80,1,2/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"Two intervals of a fourth are the principal framework of this melody. The keynote is the highest tone and the two-measure opening phrase is followed by short, somewhat exclamatory phrases which probably contain the words. The tempo is not rapid, though the message of the song is somewhat urgent."
maidu035,Hand-Game Song (a),35,,24,10,Pablo Sylvers,male,,hand game songs,43,112,,112,1,2/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"The rhythm of this song is well adapted to its use. Two intervals of a fourth characterize the framework, these being G-D, and F-C. Seven renditions were recorded, the only difference being that in the final rendition the count- division in the last count of the second measure consists of two eighths instead of a dotted eighth followed by a sixteenth note. The song is major in tonality and based on the fourth five-toned scale."
maidu036,Hand-Game Song (b),36,,25,11,Pablo Sylvers,male,,hand game songs,43,120,,120,1,2/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,minor,"This melody consists of two phrases, each with a descending trend, the song closing with an ascending interval. No differences occur in the nine renditions."
maidu037,Woman's Game Song (a),37,,43,26,Amanda Wilson,female,,woman's game songs,44,112,,112,1,2/4|3/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"The form of this pleasing melody does not suggest its use. Among all Indian tribes the songs associated with games are usually small in compass and monotonous in rhythm, with short phrases. This song has a compass of an octave and is based on the fourth five-toned scale."
maidu038,Woman's Game Song (b),38,,23,14,Amanda Wilson,female,,woman's game songs,44,100,,100,1,2/4|5/8,TRUE,,,voice,,I want that basket,minor,"The second measure of this melody occurs in twelve forms, the tones being the same, but the rhythm being different. Each of these varied occurrences is followed by the third measure of the song, which is repeated without change except for an occasional rest on the last count. This supplies the monotonous rhythm that is connected with gaming songs and becomes almost hypnotic in its many repetitions. This melody contains the tones of the minor triad and fourth."
maidu039,Woman's Game Song (c),39,,26,15,Amanda Wilson,female,,woman's game songs,45,120,,120,1,3/4|2/4|3/8|4/8|5/8,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"Frequent changes of tempo characterize this song, with its short phrases, each followed by a rest. The melody is based on the fourth five-toned scale and moves freely within its compass of six tones."
maidu040,Woman's Game Song (d),40,,44,27,Amanda Wilson,female,,woman's game songs,46,76,,76,1,3/4|5/8,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"The alternation of phrases in this song resembles that in No. 38. The changes of measure-lengths were maintained clearly, and the swaying downward and upward is interesting. A portion of the melody is above and a portion below the keynote. The song contains the tones of the fourth five-toned scale."
maidu041,The Two Girls Are Together,41,,4,2,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs connected with girls' adolescence ceremony,47,88,,88,1,3/4|2/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"A peculiarity of this song is the accidental, which was sung clearly. The performance ends on the tone above the keynote. In this, as in numerous other instances, the signature is intended to show the pitch of certain tones, not to suggest that the singer had any knowledge of our musical system."
maidu042,"Look at the Poppy Flowers, Growing Fine",42,,3,2,Pablo Sylvers,male,,songs connected with girls' adolescence ceremony,48,112,,112,1,2/4|3/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,major,"This song is minor in tonality and is characterized by the prominence of the seventh, which is a whole tone below the keynote. This tone occurs in the third, fifth, and seventh measures, approached by a descent from the keynote and followed by an ascent to that tone. This sequence is in a slightly slower tempo. The melody contains all the tones of the octave except the sixth."
maidu043,Make the Girls Happy,43,,52,31,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs connected with girls' adolescence ceremony,48,168|92,,168|92,1,3/8|5/8,TRUE,,,voice,The metronome marks are a little odd It starts in quarter=168 and then changes to eighth=184. The given tempi are all in quarters.,,minor,"The first part of this melody is based on four tones and is in a dance rhythm, with short phrases and frequent rests. After the change of tempo, the compass is extended to five tones, with A retained as the lowest tone. The rhythm is also changed for a duration of three measures, suggesting this phrase may contain the words. The song closes with a return of the opening rhythm."
maidu044,The Two Girls on the Bridge,44,,49,29,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs connected with girls' adolescence ceremony,48,100,,100,1,2/4,TRUE,,,voice,,Put the two girls on the bridge so the crow cannot get them.,minor,"Minor in tonality, this simple melody contains only the tones B flat, C, D flat, and E flat. The count-divisions are chiefly eighth and quarter notes and the song is not divided into distinct phrases. Within its small limit it is a rather wandering melody."
maidu045,Closing Song of the Adolescence Ceremony,45,,39,23,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs connected with girls' adolescence ceremony,49,112,,112,1,2/4,TRUE,,,voice,,This is the last song. Some day we will sing it for another girl.,major,"This melody is positive in rhythm and is based on the major triad. It contains no change of measure-lengths. Four phrases, or periods, comprise the song, each containing four measures. An added two-measure phrase in a different rhythm is inserted before the closing phrase of the song."
maidu046,The Neglected Wife Goes Away,46,,41,24,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs connected with stories,50,192,,192,0.5,5/8|4/8|7/8|4/8|3/8,TRUE,,,voice,,I am a fine-looking woman; still I am running with my tears.,major,"The form of this melody suggests the agitation of the neglected wife. It opens with a four-measure phrase containing three different measure-lengths. This phrase descends an octave. The next phrase, containing six measures, shows no change of measure-length and descends seven tones. (Compare No. 31.) These general characteristics are continued throughout the melody, which contains all the tones of the octave except the seventh."
maidu047,The Neglected Wife Is Pursued by Her Husband,47,,42,25,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs connected with stories,51,100|80,,100|80,1,2/4|3/4|5/8,TRUE,,,voice,,"Wait for your property, you two. Wait for your property.",major,"Like the next preceding melody, this is major in tonality and contains all the tones of the octave except the seventh. The rhythm is less irregular than in the preceding song, and the movement of the melody is less erratic and more determined. The opening phrase is based on the descending minor third C-A; the change of tempo is followed by four measures on the descending major triad D- B flat-F, after which the melody returns to the minor third. Only the first portion of the performance was transcribed."
maidu048,The Gray Squirrels and the Fire,48,,36,22,Amanda Wilson,female,,songs connected with stories,53,88,,88,1,2/4|7/8,TRUE,,,voice,,We come after the fire to put it out.,minor,"The form of this little melody suggests the limited mind and determined purpose of the gray squirrels. The melody consists of repetitions of a two-measure phrase, and the entire performance is transcribed in order to present the effect of the repetitions. The only tones are C, D, and E flat."
maidu049,Song of a Maidu Doctor,49,,38,16,Pablo Sylvers,male,,miscellaneous songs,54,108,,108,1,2/4|3/4,TRUE,,,voice,,,minor,"This pleasing melody has a compass of only four tones. In repetitions of the song, the descending phrase would have a gentle, reassuring quality. The first effort of an Indian doctor, among the many tribes studied, has been to soothe and quiet the patient."
maidu050,Song of a Hunter,50,,34,21,Pablo Sylvers,male,,miscellaneous songs,54,88,,88,1,2/4|5/8,TRUE,,,voice,,We have been hunting today. We are loaded down. The feathers are heavy.,major,"The principal intervals in this melody are whole tones, occurring between C and D and between F and G. It is an example of interval-structure in a melody, without a keynote clearly implied. It seems permissible, however, to regard F as the keynote. The third above that tone does not occur, but the sixth is a prominent interval. The song has a compass of 10 tones. This is the largest compass in the Maidu songs, except No. 27, which has a compass of 11 tones. The rhythm is irregular and the song is characterized by descending phrases."
maidu051,A Rabbit Is Going North,51,,54,22,Pablo Sylvers,male,,miscellaneous songs,55,184|152,,184|152,0.5,3/8|5/8|3/8,TRUE,,,voice,,I am hopping along. I am going north. I will get there after a while.,minor,The form of this melody is interesting in connection with the words of the song. The indicated tempo is rapid and the note-values were maintained clearly.
maidu052,A Goose Laments His Lost Brother,52,,50,21,Pablo Sylvers,male,,miscellaneous songs,55,100,,100,1,2/4,TRUE,,,voice,,How about it? My brother died. How about it? My brother died.,minor,"It is impossible to show in notation the pulsations of the singer's voice in the fourth and sixth measures. They suggest, without attempting to imitate, the sound made by the bird. The most interesting phrase is contained in the fifth and sixth measures, with their descending and ascending trend. The song contains all the tones of the octave except the seventh."
maidu053,Lullaby,53,,53,32,Amanda Wilson,female,,miscellaneous songs,56,100,,100,1,3/4,TRUE,,,voice,,The swallow (to'lip) is singing for the baby.,minor,"This monotonous little lullaby can scarcely be called a song. The oldest Indians did not regard the crooning of a mother as an integrated melody. The present lullaby is so simple that it may be very old. It consists of a one-measure phrase, repeated with occasional slight changes. It contains only the tones of the minor triad and fourth."
