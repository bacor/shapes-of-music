The final measure in every period contains two eighth notes followed by a quarter note. This phrase is sung on the lowest tone in the period which, with its frequent recurrence, gives the phrase a certain emphasis. Noting the tones on which this occurs we find them to be G, F, G, F, G, G. The tones in the first, third, fifth, and sixth periods are those of the triad of G minor, and the song is analyzed in that key.

Other songs containing the same characteristics are Nos. 3, 4, 6, 10, 15, and 16 in the Bear dance songs, and a majority of the hand game songs, Nos. 94-102. This rhythmic and melodic peculiarity suggests a vocal expression scarcely developed to the point of composed song. We find in it a resem blance to the rhythmic vocalization which accompanies concerted labor among peoples low in the scale of culture. In a majority of the songs cited the principal interval is the minor (or nonmajor) third, which characterizes the most primitive vocal expression of uncivilized peoples. (See Bull. 53, p. 7.) This interval is prominent also in the early music of civilization. The tone material of this song comprises a fundamental (G), with its minor third and minor seventh—a tone material not previously noted by the writer. For convenience the song is analyzed as in the key of G minor, though it can scarcely be said to constitute a key in the accepted sense of that term.
The rhythm of the notched-stick rattle is simple and does not vary in the songs recorded with its accompaniment. The rubbing stick is thrust downward upon the notched stick, producing a sharp, rasping sound, and as it is brought upward, preparatory to the next stroke, there is a similar but less pronounced sound, the downward stroke occupying a period of time slightly longer than that required for returning the rubbing stick to its original position. The sound pro duced by the upward motion varied with individuals, those who used he rattle with special energy producing, of course, a louder sound with the upward motion of the rubbing stick. The song under analysis is the only recorded Bear dance song in which the rattle and voice are not synchronous at the beginning of each count. In this song the tempo of the rattle is slightly slower than that of the voice."

The low G at the close of the song was given with distinctness, though it seemed to be below the natural compass of the singer's voice. No variation occurred in the four renditions of this melody. The interval of a fourth characterizes this song and is also prominent in Nos. 7, 11, 16, 20, 50, 88, 90, and 100.

In this instance the connective tone is on the same pitch as the lowest tone of the melody. A wide variety of intervals occurs in the song, a peculiarity which was noted in the more modern Sioux songs.

Concerning this characteristic among Chippewa songs, see Bulletin 45, page 142, and Bulletin 53, page 258; among the Sioux songs, see Bulletin 61, pages 184,337. This chord has been found in the music of the American Negro 18 and was noted by Prof. J. C. Fillmore in songs of the Nass River Indians living in British Columbia; also among the songs of the Dahomy collected by Prof. Fillmore at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1892.
In the songs analyzed by the present writer this chord appears in two forms: (1) In songs of minor tonality it constitutes the tonic chord with seventh added, and (2) in songs of major tonality it constitutes the submediant chord with the dominant of the key added as its highest tone. It will be noted that in the first form the tonic triad appears as the lower and in the second form as the upper portion of the chord. The second is the more frequent form, as shown by the fact that 11 Chippewa songs are characterized by this chord and only three are minor in tonality. (See song No. 30.) In the song under analysis the tonic triad (G sharp, B-D sharp) forms the framework of the melody, the seventh being less prominent and occurring only twice. The rhythmic unit is short and its repe titions comprise all the song except the closing measures. Four renditions were recorded and show no differences except that in one rendition the opening phrase, before the repeated portion, was omitted. Major and minor thirds constitute 68 per cent of the progressions."

On the first occasion the song was sung three times and on the second it was sung twice. Comparing the transcriptions of the two rendi tions, we find in the second a more regular rhythm and also an ornamentation of the melody, as in the third measure. The first-named peculiarity is shown by the presence of rhythmic units, the latter by a larger proportion of whole-tone progressions. Inquiry was made concerning the life of the singer during the two years elapsing between the making of the records, as the rhythm might possibly be influenced by an adaptation to the ways of the white man. The Government officials on the reservation were, however, of the opinion that ho appreciable change had taken place in the singer and the difference in the records was attributed by them to a difference in mood at the time of recording."

It is interesting to note that in the inter rupted portion the drumbeat is slightly after the voice, while in the remainder of the song it is synchronous with the voice. The only difference in the renditions (several of which were without drum) is that in a few instances the first tone in the second occurrence of the rhythmic unit was sung as a quarter note.

In this comparison it is found that all the renditions recorded in 1916 omit the fifth and sixth measures and the last measure of the song as transcribed. As these measures are repetitions, this would be of slight importance, but as it reduces the occurrences of these phrases from three to two the change suggests a tendency toward regularity and conventionality. The first group of renditions was in a tempo of quarter = 104, and the key of G minor: the second was faster (quarter =108) but in a lower key—the key of F sharp minor. The 5-4 division of certain measures was strictly maintained. The song contains the tones of the second five-toned scale and is melodic in structure. Considering the lack of variety in progressions the melody is inter esting and quite diversified.

Thus, in the first instance, the singer said this was a song which he sang in the war dance when he brought home a captive woman, and, in the second instance, he said it was a scalp dance song. The words were not taken in either rendition.
A comparison of the two cylinders shows the pitch of the rendi tions to be the same. Five repetitions of the song were recorded the first time and six the second time. The differences in these 11 renditions are too slight to be of importance. In the first group the opening phrase was occasionally repeated, and in the second group the ending was occasionally changed in rhythm, and the fifth measure (last two counts) contained quarter in place of eighth notes.

The structure of the song shows, however, what has been termed an ""interval-formation"" rather than a key-relation of the several tones. (See Bull. 53, pp. 7, 8.) Thus the first portion, and in every instance the rhythmic unit, is on the fifth (B flat-F), while the middle and closing measures are on the minor third (F-A flat). The intervals are larger than in a majority of these songs, about one-fourth of them being fifths. The. major second comprises only about one- sixth of the total number. Drum and voice have the same tune unit, but because of slight variations in tempo they seldom coincide for more than a few measures."
